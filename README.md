# Bioconda Tests

[![Travis tests](https://img.shields.io/travis/bioconda/bioconda-tests/master.svg?style=flat-square&label=tests)](https://travis-ci.org/bioconda/bioconda-tests)

This repository is used to trigger nightly tests of all Bioconda packages.
This way, we see breakages in packages already build, that occur due to updated dependencies.
